The researchers haven’t even recruited study participants yet, much less conducted the study or analyzed the results. The story also fails to describe how potential diagnosis might work, what the technique may cost, or what risks are involved. It’s also not clear whether any of the researchers have a potential conflict of interest. In short, the story raises far more questions than it answers. That’s problematic.\\n\\xa0', 'img': 'https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-973719052-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-973719052.jpg 724w', 'Why This Matters': 'Alzheimer’s disease affects around 5 million Americans — and that number is expected to double by 2060. The disease adversely affects the quality of life for both patients and their loved ones, and it is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. In short, Alzheimer’s disease is a big deal, and any new advances in risk assessment or diagnosis are newsworthy.\\nHowever, because this is a subject that many people are passionate about, it is especially important to approach new research responsibly. In this instance, the study has not even taken place yet, and the story fails to answer most of the major questions one might have regarding Alzheimer’s research.\\nWe can understand that a research institution may want to raise awareness of a forthcoming study in order to recruit study participants. We are less clear on why a major news outlet would write about the research — which hasn’t even taken place yet — as if it is already newsworthy and generating data that clinical decisions can be based upon.'}, 'criteria': [{'question': 'Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'Cost is not discussed. And there are multiple costs to consider here: the cost of the virtual reality (VR) hardware itself, the cost of whatever software the study participants would be using, and the cost of training professionals to interpret the data generated by study participants using the virtual reality technology. (Note: we say “study participants” because there are no patients yet, but — ultimately — the cost to patients is what we’d be interested in.)'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Not Applicable', 'explanation': 'This is tricky. The study has not yet taken place, so there are no benefits to discuss — which makes it difficult to ding the story for failing to quantify the benefits. As such, we’ll rate this as not applicable. However, our reasons for rating it N/A highlight a critical problem with the story, which we address in Quality of Evidence and Availability, below.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The big risk here, as with any screening test, is incorrect results. Even if the study hasn’t happened yet, and important data sets like sensitivity and specificity can’t yet be quantified, they should be addressed in the story. What are sensitivity and specificity? Sensitivity measures how often a test correctly generates a positive result for people who have the condition that’s being tested for. Specificity measures a test’s ability to correctly generate a negative result for people who don’t have the condition that’s being tested for. In other words, there are two possible harms inherent in diagnostic and risk assessment tools: the failure to identify someone who has Alzheimer’s; and the “false positive” misdiagnosis of people who do not have Alzheimer’s. Either mistake can have significant costs — financial and personal — for patients.'}, {'question': 'Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? ', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story offers a rough overview of the size of the forthcoming study. But it fails to address key points about the study. How will the study assess a patient’s navigation skills (which the point of using a VR device)? How will it distinguish between people whose navigation skills are poor because of early neural degeneration, versus people who have never been good at navigating? Is this a longitudinal study, with patients participating in the study over the course of years, coupled with long-term follow-up to determine if and when patients develop Alzheimer’s or other, related conditions? Those are all good questions, and they are not answered here.'}, {'question': 'Does the story commit disease-mongering?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'No disease mongering here.'}, {'question': 'Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story notes that the forthcoming study has received funding from the Alzheimer’s Society. However, the only source cited in the story is one of the researchers who will be conducting the study. Input from an independent expert about the viability of such a study would have been very welcome.'}, {'question': 'Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'There is no discussion of other approaches that are used to identify people who have Alzheimer’s disease among high-risk groups. There is also no acknowledgement of the fact that there is no definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease in patients while they are still alive (the only definitive diagnostic technique involves an autopsy). That’s a heck of an oversight.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'On the one hand, the story does tell readers that there will be a forthcoming study to evaluate whether VR technology can be used to test people’s navigation ability in order to determine whether it is an effective technique for diagnosing Alzheimer’s. (In other words, they don’t even know if this is something that will work yet.)\\nOn the other hand, earlier in the story, readers run across sentences like: “Virtual reality to help detect early risk of Alzheimer’s” and “Those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to Alzheimer’s later in life, scientists now believe.” That makes it sound like this is already a useful tool, and availability could be right around the corner. Ultimately, the story never explicitly tells readers that any possible VR tool is years away, at best. That tips the scales for us, and we lean in the direction of “not satisfactory” on this criterion. One wonders how many people read this story and contacted their general practitioner about taking a VR test to assess their Alzheimer’s risk.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story does note that previous work has been done determining that navigational skills are an early indicator of Alzheimer’s risk. However, the story makes it seem like the use of VR technology is what’s new here. That’s not true. We found studies using VR to assess issues related to navigation ability and Alzheimer’s dating back to at least 2008 and 2009. So, what sets the forthcoming study apart? We wish the story had made that clear.'}, {'question': 'Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?', 'answer': 'Not Applicable', 'explanation': 'We couldn’t find a related news release, so we’ll rate this N/A.'}], 'news_source': 'The Guardian'}, {'link': 'https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/in-story-on-experimental-contraceptive-gel-reuters-lets-drug-company-control-the-narrative/', 'title': 'In story on experimental contraceptive gel, Reuters lets drug company control the narrative', 'description': 'This leaves both investors and lay audiences without enough information to evaluate how useful the new product will be, should it pass muster with the FDA.', 'original_title': \"Evofem's birth control gel meets main study goal; shares rise\", 'news_id': 'story_reviews_00001', 'rating': 3, 'reviewers': ['Jill U.

However, it could have explained that better: In the contraceptive research world, this generally means that the failure rate is 14 pregnancies per 100 women in a year. But researchers only studied the gel for seven menstrual cycles.\\nThe story compares this pregnancy rate to a couple of of other forms of birth control, which is good, but it’s worth pointing out that those failure rates have far more evidence behind them. The efficacy rate for this new product is based on just one industry study.\\nAlso, the story makes a vague reference that the gel may kill “certain viral and bacterial pathogens that can cause sexually transmitted diseases.” Only at the end of the story do we find out that researchers have no data yet for this claim.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'We’ll give this a just-passing satisfactory score because side effects were briefly mentioned: “no serious side effects were observed in the study.” Still we’d like to see mention of less serious side effects, especially for a birth control intervention, because they’re often a significant factor in women’s choices.'}, {'question': 'Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? ', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story gives some study details, regarding the subjects. However, we don’t know the study’s duration, which could affect side effects and efficacy. No mention is made of how the product is used or how compliant study subjects were, which are two key factors for any birth control method. Also, the study details were provided by the company, not by an independently run study, although the story notes this. The fact that the study hasn’t been published and peer reviewed is also not mentioned.'}, {'question': 'Does the story commit disease-mongering?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'There’s no disease mongering in the story.'}, {'question': 'Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'With a new birth control product, we’d like to see comments from independent physicians or researchers that are experts in the field–and we think this is something investors would value seeing, too. However, this story quotes the CEO of the product’s maker, as well as two business analysts.'}, {'question': 'Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story mentions other birth control products, such as male condoms and birth control pills.\\nHowever, the story sharply misleads readers by claiming that the positive results with the gel brings: “the first hormone-free contraceptive close to approval.” That’s simply wrong. Current hormone-free products include male condoms, copper IUDs, diaphragms, and cervical caps.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story makes clear that this a product under development, not yet approved or marketed.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story describes how the new product differs from male condoms — “woman-controlled” — and how it differs from oral pills — “non-hormonal.” But this isn’t novel, as we describe in alternatives.\\nAlthough testing is still underway, as the story notes, what’s interesting is that the gel may have some effectiveness against some sexually transmitted diseases, which would make it different from most other forms of female-based contraceptives.

For Cosentyx, around $4,700 (unclear if dosing is equivalent to Tremfya).\\nRegardless, drug costs for severe cases of psoriasis can quickly get into the tens of thousands of dollars for some patients.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'From the story:\\nAfter 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of patients treated with Tremfya showed 90 percent improvement in disease symptoms [as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)], while only 70 percent of those treated with Cosentyx showed similar results.\\nIt’s also noted that Cosentyx had a “slightly more rapid onset of response.”\\xa0This is just enough to merit a satisfactory rating.\\nWhat’s not mentioned is that superiority of Tremfya was NOT demonstrated in five secondary endpoints. (As noted in this news release from Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.) Also, we also think it would be valuable to tap an independent source to answer: How clinically significant is it that 14.5% of patients did better on Janssen’s Tremfya?'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'Since Tremfya is known to weaken the immune system, it places patients at an increased risk of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.\\nPeople taking this drug, and other immunosuppressives like it, must be screened for tuberculosis, since it could dramatically accelerate the disease.\\nNone of this was mentioned.'}, {'question': 'Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? ', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The results come from this\\xa0Janssen-sponsored Eclipse trial — a phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double blind comparison of Tremfya, and the competing drug Cosentyx (from Novartis AG). However, the story provided scant details on the study, so readers would be unable to establish the quality of the evidence without going and looking up the study details. Was it randomized and blinded? What were the limitations? Has the trial been peer reviewed and published? Those are the details we’re looking for.'}, {'question': 'Does the story commit disease-mongering?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'No disease mongering.\\nThe story does well to inform readers that plaque psoriasis is fairly common, affecting about 7.5 million Americans.'}, {'question': 'Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'Two glaring problems here.\\nFirst, the only quote used in this very short story is directly lifted (without attribution) from the news release. No independent sources are included.\\nFurthermore, it says it comes from the lead investigator of the study (true), but fails to mention he’s a paid consultant for Janssen.'}, {'question': 'Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'Another weakness of this story is that alternatives are not mentioned. In addition to a multitude of other immunosuppressant drugs, there are a host of treatments available for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, including:\\nLight therapy, Vitamin A & D derivatives, as well as other medications that don’t work via immune system suppression.\\nAlso, bear in mind, these are symptomatic treatments only, since there is no known cure for psoriasis.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'Availability is implied but it should have been made more clear when these drugs received FDA approval, and what they’re approved for.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'There are a number of other biologic drugs that treat psoriasis by altering the immune system (this makes sense, because psoriasis is an autoimmune condition), but Tremfya blocks a specific part of the immune system that has not been targeted before. In other words, it is “first in class.” The article does not touch on this.'}, {'question': 'Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The only quote used is drawn directly from the news release, without attribution.'}], 'news_source': 'Reuters'}, {'link': 'https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/a-little-more-context-would-have-boosted-already-strong-healthday-story-on-drug-for-hot-flashes/', 'title': 'A little more context would have boosted already-strong HealthDay story on drug for hot flashes', 'description': 'Did the study findings really earn a label of “game-changing?”', 'original_title': ' Incontinence Drug May Cut Hot Flashes in Breast Cancer Survivors', 'news_id': 'story_reviews_00004', 'rating': 5, 'reviewers': ['Sue Rochman', 'Karen Carlson, MD', 'Joy Victory'], 'category': 'HealthDay', 'tags': ['breast cancer', 'hot flashes'], 'source_link': 'https://consumer.healthday.com/women-s-health-information-34/menopause-and-postmenopause-news-472/incontinence-drug-may-cut-hot-flashes-in-breast-cancer-survivors-740325.html', 'summary': {'Our Review Summary': 'The San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium typically generates extensive media coverage of new research studies. However, not all of the studies presented are of the same caliber and some will never undergo the peer review that will lead them to be published in a medical journal. This means reporters needs to be at the top of their game when evaluating the news releases they receive about studies that will be presented at the meeting.\\nThis story from HealthDay does many things right — it covers costs, side effects, study limitations, and more. This earned it five stars from us. However, we do think the story would have been even stronger if it had better emphasized a key fact: The overall reduction in hot flashes was roughly 28 to 23 in the drug group and 28 to 25 in the placebo group. That’s not much, and raises eyebrows in light of a physician in the story calling it “game-changing.”\\n\\xa0', 'img': 'https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-973159304-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-973159304.jpg 724w', 'Why This Matters': 'Many breast cancer treatments are known to cause hot flashes. Some premenopausal women have treatments that put them into immediate menopause; others enter menopause naturally while they are being treated for breast cancer; and still others are postmenopausal and find the drugs used to treat their breast cancer cause their hot flashes to return or become more frequent. Hot flashes and night sweats can affect quality of life, and it would be great if there was an easy way to control them without using menopausal hormone therapy which\\xa0has never been recommended for women with breast cancer as it is known to increase breast cancer risk.\\nHowever, as multiple studies have shown, many drugs over the years rarely perform much better than a placebo–as was the case in this study of oxybutynin. Yet, this study got widespread play as game-changing.'}, 'criteria': [{'question': 'Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'Using the lead researcher as a source, the article states that most insurers cover oxybutynin; that a month’s supply can range from $21 to $42; and that the cost could be less, depending on the type of insurance a patient has.\\nKudos to HealthDay for explicitly addressing cost.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The article reports that the study found the women on oxybutynin had an average of five fewer hot flashes per week, while those on the placebo had three fewer. It’s not clear if the benefit was the same for both doses. The story explains that this was from a group 150 women who experienced at least 28 hot flashes a week. This is enough information to glean the magnitude of benefit.\\nBut, the story could have used more context: The drug resulted in five fewer hot flashes a week. That’s not even one less hot flash per day. And those on the placebo, which costs nothing and has no side effects, has three fewer hot flashes a week. That’s a difference of two hot flashes a week–which seems like a really low bar.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The article says that side effects included constipation, mild diarrhea, dry mouth, dry eyes, episodes of confusion and difficulty urinating. It’s not noted if these side effects were seen in both the low-dose and high-dose groups. There is also no indication of which side effects were most common or how many women experienced them.\\nImportantly, though, the article does note that the long-term effects of the drug aren’t known and that oxybutynin is in a class of drugs that “have been linked with mental decline” and that previous studies have found “the drugs may raise the risk for problems with short-term memory, reasoning and confusion, and may also hike the risk for dementia among older patients.”\\nInformation on ClincalTrials.gov about the trial suggests this study evaluated two doses in an effort to find an effective dose with fewer side effects.'}, {'question': 'Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? ', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The concluding paragraph of the article states that the study was scheduled to be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium and that “studies presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until peer-reviewed for publication in a medical journal.”\\nIt’s important to note this. But the wording also indicates that the article was written before the presentation was even given and the the reporter never saw the researcher’s data or slides or heard any questions the audience may have asked regarding the findings.'}, {'question': 'Does the story commit disease-mongering?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'It’s indisputable that many women going through menopause experience hot flashes and that side effects of many breast cancer treatments include hot flashes, in some cases because the treatment puts a woman into immediate menopause. They result from fluctuations in women’s hormones.'}, {'question': 'Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The article quotes Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at the Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, NY, who was not affiliated with the study. We did not detect any conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed.'}, {'question': 'Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The article makes it sound like the only option for treating hot flashes is menopausal hormone therapy. But, in fact, there are other ways to treat hot flashes that are currently recommended. These include drugs used for other purposes as well as non-drug options like mind-body approaches.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The article states that the drug, which is approved to treat incontinence, is readily available.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'This is the first time that a drug is this class has been shown to have an effect on hot flashes, and so is newsworthy for this reason. That could have been more explicit in the story, though.'}, {'question': 'Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The article included original comments not found in the news release.'}], 'news_source': 'Health Day'}]\n"
